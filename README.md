## Garmin mount for bicycle aerobars

This mount allows you use a Garmin bike computer, with it's standard mount,
with a set of aerobars that have 3 inches between them.

This works perfectly for a Colnago K.Zero set of aerobars.  For other bars, YMMV, but you can
modify the file to get the size you need.  The mount puts the computer further
forward than other mounts, so you can easily see the computer display while in
an aero tuck.

To mount a Garmin computer, use a spare handlebar mount, and shave off the 4
corner tabs.  Epoxy the mount into the cutout on this print, for a tight fit.
Let the expoxy dry completely before riding.

Ziptie the mount to the bars using ties that fit through the holes in the
part.
